# Indian Cuisine Analysis

“If cuisines were people, French food would be a goody-two-shoes know it all, always the first to have their hand up in class, and Indian food would be the rebel at the back of the class in a leather jacket who everyone is intimidated by but secretly wants to be friends with. That’s because Indian food breaks all the rules of cooking.”

What distinguishes it from most Western cuisines? - While most western meals are based on the same concept and follow similar trends - Flavor Pairing. Chefs in the West prefer to use ingredients that have overlapping flavours.
So, what distinguishes Indian cuisine? - Most Asian cuisines prefer meals with distinct flavour profiles, and Indian cuisine, in particular, is a fantastic illustration of this trend.

This project aims to analyse the various trends within the Indian cuisine and what makes it so unique. The objective is to bring forth interesting observations. We have also trained ML models to predict the flavours and regions of the dishes
