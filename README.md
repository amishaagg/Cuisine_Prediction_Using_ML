# Indian Cuisine Analysis

“If cuisines were people, French food would be a goody-two-shoes know it all, always the first to have their hand up in class, and Indian food would be the rebel at the back of the class in a leather jacket who everyone is intimidated by but secretly wants to be friends with. That’s because Indian food breaks all the rules of cooking.”

What distinguishes it from most Western cuisines? - While most western meals are based on the same concept and follow similar trends - Flavor Pairing. Chefs in the West prefer to use ingredients that have overlapping flavours.
So, what distinguishes Indian cuisine? - Most Asian cuisines prefer meals with distinct flavour profiles, and Indian cuisine, in particular, is a fantastic illustration of this trend.

This project aims to analyse the various trends within the Indian cuisine and what makes it so unique. The objective is to bring forth interesting observations. We have also trained ML models to predict the flavours and regions of the dishes

# Dataset

Each row of the dataset contains the following columns: 
- name: Name of the dish
- ingredients: main ingredients used
- diet: type of diet - either vegetarian or nonvegetarian
- prep_time : preparation time
- cook_time: cooking time
- flavor_profile:  describes the flavor of the dish as spicy, sweet, bitter, etc.
- course: course of the meal - starter, main course, dessert, etc
- state: the state where the dish is famous or is originated
- region: the region where the state belongs
